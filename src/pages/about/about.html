    The World Health Organization (WHO) uses a class
    system to define obesity (Table 1). Statistics for 2013
    from the UK, Health and Social Care Information Centre
    show that in adults, 24% of men and 25% of women
    are classified as obese and over 3% have class-3 obesity
    [5]. For an average UK district general hospital serving
    an adult population of 200 000, this equates to 52 000
    obese and over 6000 class-3 obese patients [6].
    Obese patients are more likely to present to hospital
    because they are more prone to concomitant disease.
    Between 2001–2002 and 2011–2012, there was an
    eleven-fold increase in the number of patients (from
    1019 to 11 736) of all ages admitted to NHS hospitals
    with a primary diagnosis of obesity (Fig. 1) [6]. In
    2007, the UK Government’s Foresight Report predicted
    that 50% of the UK population would be clinically
    obese by 2050, costing the NHS an extra £45.5 billion
    (€61.5 billion; $70.1 billion) per year, but even this
    may be an underestimate [7].
    This consensus guidance is a synthesis of expert
    opinion, current practice and literature review,
    designed to replace the 2007 edition [1] and act as a
    guide to the delivery of safe anaesthesia to this clinically
    demanding group</p>
